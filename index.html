        <p id="bio">I like to play tennis when I have free time. Over the weekends, after I have finished all my homework, I go to play tennis. I am 12 years old and in 7th grade. Tennis is a good hobby because it's a form of excersise and I can stay fit. This hobby can be developed by anyone but I got it from my parents, since they got me interested in tennis at a young age. Playing tennis makes me happy and keeps me busy. It's a good source of physical activiy, increases your hand-eye coordination and it makes you run and jump faster. It also makes you stronger and improves your aim.</p>
